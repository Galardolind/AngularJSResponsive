# AngularJSResponsive

##Overview

The purpose of this project is to show that I am capable of making a website with a responsive design and that I can use AngularJS technologies.

To watch the website in your navigator you must have a web server (e.g. XAMPP).
If you don't use a server, your browser will block the cross origin requests made by AngularJs to load all the files.


##Technologies

HTML/CSS/JS, JQuery, AngularJs, Bootstrap
